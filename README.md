# Kuznet-Ratio
The **Kuznet ratio** is a metric used to assess the relationship between income inequality and economic development. It is named after economist **Simon Kuznets**, who hypothesized that as an economy develops, income inequality first increases and then decreases, creating an inverted U-shaped curve over time.

The Kuznet ratio is typically calculated as:

$$
\text{Kuznet Ratio} = \frac{\text{Gini Index}}{\text{GDP per capita}}
$$

Where:
- **Gini Index**: A measure of income inequality within a country, where 0 represents perfect equality and 1 represents perfect inequality.
- **GDP per capita**: The gross domestic product (GDP) divided by the total population of the country, indicating the average income or output per person.

### Interpretation:
- A **higher Kuznet ratio** suggests higher income inequality relative to the economic output per person, possibly indicating that the benefits of economic growth are not equally distributed.
- A **lower Kuznet ratio** suggests more balanced income distribution relative to the country's economic output.

This ratio is often used in analyzing economic development and how wealth is distributed as countries progress through various stages of economic growth.
